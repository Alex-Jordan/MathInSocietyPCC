		Another important part of democracy is how to fund the government. We studied how to calculate Federal Income Taxes in LINKSection 2.5. In this section we will study where that money goes and what happens when the government spends more than it earns in taxes.

<title>Federal Income and Spending</title>
	<p>
		Federal income comes from our individual income taxes and business income taxes. Income is also borrowed by selling savings bonds, notes and Treasury bills<fn><url href="https://www.usa.gov/budget">https://www.usa.gov/budget</url></fn>. The government spends money to pay interest on the national debt. After that, there are two types of spending, mandatory and discretionary. <alert>Mandatory spending</alert> includes Social Security payments, Medicare and other items required by law. <alert>Discretionary spending</alert> is the amount that Congress budgets annually to fund programs and agencies. Here is a pie chart showing the percentage of spending for each type in 2019<fn><url href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-federal-government-spend-its-money">https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-federal-government-spend-its-money</url></fn>.

<subsection>
<title>The Federal Budget Process</title>
	<p>
		The <alert>Federal Budget</alert> is like a home budget, with income and expenses. The U.S. Government’s fiscal year goes from October 1st of one year to September 30th of the next year. Work on the budget begins about a year and a half before the budget is finalized.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, departments and agencies submit their proposals to the White House. Then the President submits their budget plan to Congress. Each chamber of Congress analyzes the proposal and makes their own budget resolution. Then a conference committee of House and Senate members resolves the differences between the two plans and makes a final version that each chamber votes on.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the budget is passed, the Senate and House Appropriations committees distribute the discretionary part of the funding among 12 subcommittees that oversee different groups of agencies. As before, conference committees meet to merge the two versions of the appropriations bills. All 12 bills must be passed by both the Senate and the House and then signed by the President to enact the new budget.
	</p>
	<p>
		If any appropriations bill is not signed by September 30th, there is no budget for the new fiscal year. In this case, Congress must pass a <alert>continuing resolution</alert> to temporarily fund the government. If they do not, or if the president does not sign it, the governement will shut down. The last <alert>government shutdown</alert> went from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019. This was the longest shudown in U.S. history and left over 800,000 federal workers either working without pay or being furloughed at home<fn><url href="https://www.thoughtco.com/history-and-effects-of-government-shutdowns-3321444">https://www.thoughtco.com/history-and-effects-of-government-shutdowns-3321444</url></fn>.

<subsection>
<title>The Federal Surplus or Deficit</title>
	<p>
		If the government spends less than it collects in income, there will be a budget <alert>surplus</alert> for that year. If it spends more than it collects, there will be a <alert>deficit</alert> for that year. It is also possilbe to have a <alert>balanced budget</alert> where the spending equals the income. The federal deficit refers to the budget shortfall in a single time period, like a quarter or a year. For example, in the Fiscal Year 2018, the U.S. deficit was $779 billion. The graph below shows the federal defecit or surplus each year since 1974<fn><url href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/government-spending/debt-and-deficits-cbo%E2%80%99s-updated-budget-outlook-2014-2024">https://www.mercatus.org/publications/government-spending/debt-and-deficits-cbo%E2%80%99s-updated-budget-outlook-2014-2024</url></fn>.

		It is hard to find graphs with a vertical axis in dollars becase the value of the dollar changes over time. One dollar in 1974 could buy a lot more than it can today. In the graph above they converted each year to the equivalent of 2013 dollars to account for that. The vertical scale is in billions of 2013 dollars. The largest deficits in 2009 to 2012 were from spending and corporate bailouts to recover from the Great Recession of 2008.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the graph above, a 1 on the vertical scale is one billion dollars or $1,000,000,000. The highest deficits go down to about -$1,500 billion, which we would write as -$1,500,000,000,000. Here is a chart that shows large numbers and how many zeros they have.

		Instead of writing all the zeros, we can abreviate large numbers using decimals. For example, 1,200,000 can be written as 1.2 million. We can write 900,000 as 0.9 million. We can also translate the other way and write 4.567 trillion as 4,567,000,000,000. Note there can be more than one way to write a number. We could write 400,000,000 as either 400 million or 0.4 billion. It is convenient that we put the decimal where the comma goes and vice versa.

<title>Debt to GDP Ratio</title>
	<p>
		A more common way to measure the defecit is as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product. The <alert>Gross Domestic Product</alert>, or <alert>GDP</alert>, is the total value of all the finished goods and services produced within a county’s borders in a specific period of time. The GDP is a measure of the size of an economy. The growth rate of the GDP is one measure of a nation’s economic health<fn><url href="https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product">https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product</url></fn>. The GDP of the United States in 2019 was $21.43 trillion<fn><url href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-fourth-quarter-and-year-2019-advance-estimate#:~:text=Current%2Ddollar%20GDP%20increased%204.1,table%201%20and%20table%203).">https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/gross-domestic-product-fourth-quarter-and-year-2019-advance-estimate#:~:text=Current%2Ddollar%20GDP%20increased%204.1,table%201%20and%20table%203).</url></fn>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we can look at more graphs that are written in terms of the percent of GDP. Here is a graph of federal spending and revenues as a percentage of the GDP.

	<p>
		For each year, if we take the revenue and subtract the spending, we get the budget surplus or deficit. If the result is negative it is a deficit. And here is a graph of the deficits in terms of percentage of GDP<fn><url href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55151">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55151</url></fn>.

<subsection>
<title>National Debt</title>
	<p>
		The words deficit and debt are easily confused because they have similar meanings. The <alert>deficit</alert> is the yearly shortfall, and the national <alert>debt</alert> is the total cumulative amount of debt held by the government.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you can see from the previous graphs, most years had a budget deficit. If we add all of those up over time, this is what the national debt looks like<fn><url href="https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0025_federal-debt-hist">https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0025_federal-debt-hist</url></fn>.

	<p>
		Just like we pay interest on our personal debt, the U.S. pays interest on the national debt. The interest on the debt is expected to keep increasing as shown in this graph<fn><url href="https://www.pgpf.org/analysis/2018/12/higher-interest-rates-will-raise-interest-costs-on-the-national-debt">https://www.pgpf.org/analysis/2018/12/higher-interest-rates-will-raise-interest-costs-on-the-national-debt</url></fn>.

<title>U.S. Debt Clock</title>
	<p>
		The numbers are always changing, so to see the current amount of national debt, go to the <url href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/">US Debt Clock</url> website. The screenshot below was taken from the site on July 22, 2020:

	<p>
		This is just one part of the debt clock. It shows us the total of the national debt, the debt per citizen and debt per taxpayer. It also shows us the spending and deficit with counters that are constantly moving. At the bottom you can also see the debt to GDP ratio compared with previous ratios. The rest of the website shows statistics like the U.S. population, GDP, income tax revenue, median income, unemployment and much more. You can also see statistics for other states and countries.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now let’s do some calculations with these large numbers in the next example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Here are some approximate values for the U.S. from the fiscal year 2018: October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Federal Budget (Spending): $4.407 trillion
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Federal Revenue Estimate: $3.422 trillion
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						National Debt:  $21.803 trillion
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Interest on the National Debt for 2018: $332.637 billion
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Gross Domestic Product: $20.656 trillion
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Population: 329 million people
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<ol label="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						Calculate the budget surplus or deficit for this fiscal year.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Calculate the debt to GDP ratio as a percentage.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						How much debt does the U.S. have per person (per capita)?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						How much interest is due on the national debt per person?
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol label="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						To calculate the budget surplus or deficit, we subtract the spending from the revenue, and we get:
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow>\text{Revenue-Spending}=$3.422 \text{ trillion } - $4.407 \text{ trillion }</mrow>
							<mrow>=-$0.985 \text{ trillion, or, } -$985 \text{ billion}</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						The result is negative, so there is a deficit of $985 billion. The word deficit indicates that the number is negative. If we wrote a deficit of -$985 billion that would be a double negative.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To calculate the debt to GDP ratio, we divide using the order of the wording. For example, the ratio of a to b would be <m>a:b</m> or <m>a÷b</m>. So, we will take the total amount of national debt and divide it by the GDP:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{national debt}}{\text{GDP}}= \frac{$21.803\text{ trillion}{$20.656 \text{ trillion}}=1.06 \text{ or } 106\%</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						The debt to GDP ratio is 106%.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<q>Per</q> is another key word for division, so to calculate the debt per capita or per person, we divide the national debt by the population.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{national debt}}{\text{population}} =\frac{$21.803\text{ trillion}}{329\text{ million people}}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice that the debt is written in trillions and the population is in millions, so we can’t divide these numbers yet. We need to put them into the same units. We can either write both of them in expanded form like this:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{$21,803,000,000,000}{$329,000,000}=$66,271\text{ per person}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						Or instead of writing out all the zeros, we can convert one of the numbers to match the other. In this situation it seems easier to convert $21.803 trillion to 21,803,000 million and then divide.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{$21.803 \text{ trillion}}{329\text{ million people}}=\frac{$21,803,000 \text{ million}}{329 \text{ million people}}=$66,271\text{ per person}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To find out how much interest is due on the national debt per person, we will divide the interest by the population.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{interest}}{\text{population}}=\frac{$332.637}{329\text{ million people}}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, the units do not match. This time we will convert the other way and change 329 million people into 0.329 billion people, and we have: 
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>=\frac{$332.637\text{ billion}}{0.329\text{ billion}}=$1,011.05 \text{ per person}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						Or you can always write out all the zeros like this and get the same answer.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{$332,637,000,000}{329,000,000}=$1,011.05\text{ per person}</m>
					</p>
				</li>

			One advantage of the Debt to GDP ratio is you can compare different countries with economies of different sizes. Let’s look at South Korea for comparison. Here are some approximate values, from 2020<fn><url href="https://commodity.com/debt-clock/southkorea/">https://commodity.com/debt-clock/southkorea/</url></fn>. The unit of money in South Korea is the South Korean won, ₩.
			<ul>

				</li>
				<li>

						Gross Domestic Product: ₩1.731 quadrillion
					</p>

				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol label="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						First, we divide the amount of debt by the GDP.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{national debt}}{\text{GDP}} = \frac{\text{₩} 754.835\text{ Trillion}}{\text{₩} 1.71\text{ Quadrillion}}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						Since one of the numbers is in trillions and the other in quadrillions, we have to make them match before we can divide. We will change the GDP into Trillions:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{₩} 754.835\text{ Trillion}}{\text{₩} 1.71\text{ Quadrillion}}=0.44 \text{ or } 44\%</m> 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To find the amount of debt per person, we divde the debt by the number of people.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{national debt}}{\text{population}} = \frac{\text{₩} 754.835\text{ Trillion}}{50.617\text{ million people}}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						Again the units don’t match so we must either write all the zeros or make sure they are in the same units. In this case we will change the debt into millions but there are many ways you could do it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>frac{\text{₩} 754.835\text{ Trillion}}{50.617\text{ million people}}=\text{₩}14,912,677.56 \text{ per person}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To find the amount of interest paid per year per person, we divde the amount of interest by the number of people.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{interest}}{\text{population}} = \frac{\text{₩} 30.055 \text{ Trillion}}{50.617\text{ million people}}</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						We will change the interest to millions and divide.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\text{₩} 30.055 \text{ Trillion}}{50.617\text{ million people}}= \text{₩}593,772.84\text{ per person}</m>
