<title>Introduction to The Normal Distribution</title>
	<p>
		Although the characteristics of the population (parameters) may be unknown, random sampling can be used to yield reliable estimates for the population variable being studied. Sample data can be plotted on graphs (like histograms or boxplots) to provide a visual representation of the distribution of data values.
	</p>
	<p>
		Take, for example, the heights of all of the women at PCC. If we were to take a random sample of female PCC students and record their heights, we would most likely find the majority of the heights would be close to a central value, the mean, with larger or smaller values becoming less and less common. The resulting distribution might look something like this:
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="40%">
		<image source="images/statistics/3_6/intro_pic.png"></image>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		This type of distribution is symmetric and is called bell-shaped distribution The  formal name for this distribution is called the Normal Distribution. When sampling from a population the data set obtained are almost never exactly normally distributed, we say that the data is approximately normal.

			<li>
				<p>
					The distribution is symmetric about the mean which is in the center of the distribution.

			<li>
				<p>
					The distribution is unimodal.

			<li>
				<p>
					The mean, median and mode are approximately the same value.
				</p>

					Almost all of the area under a Normal Distribution curve is within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

<title>The Empirical Rule for the Normal Distribution</title>
	<p>
		For a Normal Distribution, we use the standard deviation to describe the variation, or spread of the data values around the mean. The standard deviation is commonly represented by the lowercase Greek letter sigma, <m>\sigma</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The way the variation is distributed in the curve follows what we call the Empirical Rule (also called the 68-95-99.7 Rule).
	</p>
	<p>
		From <xref ref="mean18_and_sd4"></xref> The test scores on a math quiz are approximately normally distributed with mean 18 and standard deviation 4.
	</p>
	<p>
		About 68% of all the data values fall within one standard deviation.

<title>The Standard Normal Distribution</title>
	<p>
		Recall we used  the standard score called a Z-score, which is a method commonly used with unimodal and symmetric distributions (called <alert>normal</alert> or <alert>nearly normal distributions</alert>).
	</p>
	<p>
		To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we find out how far away from the mean it is by subtracting. Then we divide by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the <alert>Z-score</alert> of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
	<title>Z-score</title>
		<p>
			<m>Z=\frac{\text{Data Value } - \text{ Mean}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}</m>
		</p>
		<p>
			Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide.
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		A standard score (also called <q>z-score</q>) is the number of standard deviations a data value is from the mean of the distribution. We can plot z-scores on a special normal distribution called the standard normal distribution. The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution that always has population mean 0 and population standard deviation of 1.

	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		Applying the Empirical Rule (also called the 68-95-99.7 Rule) to the standard normal curve and using the rules for symmetry the following percentages of data values that fall between standard deviations.

	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		Applying the Empirical Rule to the standard normal distribution, we know that 68% of all z-scores will be between -1 and 1, 95% of all z-scores will be between -2 and 2, and 99.7% of all z-scores will be between -3 and 3. A z-score below -3 or above 3 is possible, but is very unlikely.

<title>The Confidence Interval and Margin of Error</title>
	<p>
		A point estimate provides a plausible single value for a parameter. That is when you take a sample and calculate the  mean. However a point estimate is rarely perfect because there is some error in the estimate. In addition each sample varies so the next logical step is to provide a range of values that is an estimate for the parameter.    We call this range of values a confidence interval.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we only use a point estimate it is highly unlikely that we will hit the exact value of the population parameter being studied but it is our best guess for the value of the parameter. It is more likely to capture the population parameter if we construct a confidence interval.
	</p>
	<p>
		Say you were interested in the mean height of 10-year-old girls living in the United States. It would cost to much money and take to much time to weigh all 10 year old girls so you would take a sample. You take a sample of 25 and found that the mean weight was 93 pounds.  This is an example of a point estimate. It is highly unlikely that the entire U.S. population of 10-year-old girls has a mean of 93 pounds. If we know that the standard error of estimate for  the weight of 10 year old girls  is 2.5 pounds we can construct a confidence interval  to estimate the population mean weight.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most common confidence interval that is constructed is the 95% confidence interval. The 95% confidence interval captures the middle 95% of the normal curve. The middle 95% is 1.96 standard deviations from the mean.
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="40%">
		<image source="images/statistics/3_6/95perc_interval_pic.png"></image>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		<md>
			<mrow>\text{Point estimate } \pm 1.96 \times SE</mrow>
			<mrow>93 \pm 1.96(2.5)</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
 	<p>
 		To find the lower boundary of the confidence interval take <m>93 – 1.96(2.5)</m>
 	</p>
 	<p>
 		To find the upper boundary of the confidence interval take <m>93 + 1.96(2.5)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		The 95% confidence interval is 88.1 to 97.9. or (88.1, 97.9)
	</p>
	<p>
		Interpreting the 95%: We are 95% confidence that the true weight of all 10-year-old girls is between 88.1 and 97.9 pounds.
	</p>
	<p>
		That is if repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval computed for each sample, 95% of the intervals would contain the population mean. 5% of the intervals would not contain the population mean.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <m>1.96 \times \text{SE}</m>. is called the margin of error. <m>1.96(2.5) =  4.9</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		The margin of error is the range of values below and above your sample mean in the confidence interval.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter, so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value. The standard error, which is the measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval. When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonable be modeled as normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest. We can be 95% confidence  this interval captures the true value.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea behind confidence intervals and margin of error is that any survey, study or poll will always different from the population because samples have variability. The confidence interval and margin of error reflects the fact that there is always room for error.
